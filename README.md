# godot-developer-console
An easy-to-use, simple in-game console inspired by the console used in Valve Source 1.

## Features
- Cross-language scripting: bind & call console commands from C#, GDScript
- Helpful game-agnostic commands


### Upcoming
- Source-style autocompletion

### Notes on Cross-language scripting
- When adding console commands from GDScript, lambdas aren't currently supported - this might change in future versions of Godot.
- Todo: add examples

### Disclaimer
This addon is being developed as per my own needs.
